title: Copy configuration files.

  Use the following sequence of commands to move the SNMP
  configuration files to the SNMP service configuration directory.

  First, create the SNMP configuration directory if needed and then, from
  the installation directory, copy the configuration files to the SNMP
  service configuration directory.
  
  The configuration file name is dependant on the SNMP tool you use. For
  example, ``net-snmp`` uses ``/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`` in place of the
  ``/etc/snmp/mongod.conf`` given in the code below. Use the correct file for
  your tool when running the following commands:
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mkdir -p /etc/snmp/
    cp MONGOD-MIB.txt /usr/share/snmp/mibs/MONGOD-MIB.txt
    cp mongod.conf.subagent /etc/snmp/mongod.conf

    By default SNMP uses UNIX domain for communication between the
    agent (i.e. ``snmpd`` or the master) and sub-agent (i.e. MongoDB).
post: |
  Ensure that the ``agentXAddress`` specified in the SNMP
  configuration file for MongoDB matches the ``agentXAddress`` in the
  SNMP master configuration file.

pre: |
  Start |mongod-program| with the :setting:`snmp-subagent` to send data
  to the SNMP master.
action:
  language: sh
  code: mongod --snmp-subagent

title: Confirm SNMP data retrieval.
stepnum: 3
ref: test-snmp
pre: |
  Use ``snmpwalk`` to collect data from |mongod-program|:

  Connect an SNMP client to verify the ability to collect SNMP data
  from MongoDB.

  Install the `net-snmp <http://www.net-snmp.org/>`_ package to access
  the ``snmpwalk`` client. ``net-snmp`` provides the ``snmpwalk``
  SNMP client.
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    snmpwalk -m /usr/share/snmp/mibs/MONGOD-MIB.txt -v 2c -c mongodb 127.0.0.1:<port> 1.3.6.1.4.1.34601
post: |
  ``<port>`` refers to the port defined by the SNMP master,
  *not* the primary :setting:`~net.port` used by |mongod-program| for
  client communication.
